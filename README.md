# Jeremiah Candelaria - Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, `jeremiahcandelaria.com`. The site serves as a professional showcase of my software development work and a meta-demonstration of my skills in building high-quality, performant, and well-documented web applications.

## ➤ Design Philosophy

The site's aesthetic is **Refined Minimalism**, with a **Brutalist influence on its typography**. This is achieved through:
*   A strict black, white, and single-accent-color palette.
*   Generous whitespace to ensure content is scannable and digestible.
*   Large, confident headlines that act as a primary design element.
*   An unwavering focus on the content itself, free of unnecessary ornamentation.

For a detailed breakdown of our design system, see `_docs/ui-rules.md` and `_docs/theme-rules.md`.

## ➤ Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, performance-oriented technology stack:

**Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Framer Motion, Zustand, Vercel Analytics, and Cloudflare.**

For a detailed explanation of each technology and its role, see `_docs/tech-stack.md`.

## ➤ Development Conventions: An AI-First Approach

This codebase is designed to be **AI-first**, meaning it is optimized for comprehension by both humans and modern AI development tools. This philosophy is enforced through a strict set of rules, which include:

*   **Modularity**: A feature-based directory structure that co-locates related logic.
*   **Explicitness**: Descriptive file and component names.
*   **Mandatory Documentation**: All files and functions must have TSDoc comment blocks explaining their purpose, parameters, and usage.
*   **Strict File Length**: No file may exceed 500 lines.
*   **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages must adhere to the Conventional Commits specification.

These conventions ensure the project remains scalable, maintainable, and highly navigable. For the complete set of rules, see `_docs/project-rules.md`.
